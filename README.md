I created this using many bootstrap classes and by using d-none and d-block i changed how the resolutions changed.

Note: Desktop mode looks really good. Tablet mode and mobile mode obviously need to be cleaned up. IF given more time, try to fix spacing on tablet mode so items aren't awkardly right up to other items using padding. Mobile needs a navbar and loose text needs to be cleaned up
