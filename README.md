Hampster Hotel
I created this using many bootstrap classes and by using d-none and d-block i changed how the resolutions changed.

There were many problems with my old version of hampster hotel, but after completing puppy resturant I have a much better grip on html and bootstrap so most of my classes and previous code has been overwritten with much better code and a functional responsiveness for both mobile and tablet.

Note: Desktop mode looks really good. Tablet mode and mobile mode obviously need to be cleaned up. IF given more time, try to fix spacing on tablet mode so items aren't awkardly right up to other items using padding. Mobile needs a navbar and loose text needs to be cleaned up
